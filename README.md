# ASP-.Net-MVC-WebSite-SizceHaber

While developing this website, it is aimed to use a layered structure. Layered architecture, 
called "n-tier architecture", has an important place in the software world. It simplifies the
management and control of the project by dividing the application into logical and
physical layers, all of which have different responsibilities. For this reason, it is a life
saver in large-scale developments such as corporate automations. MVC architecture, on
the other hand, is a design pattern based on three basic components: "Model", "View",
"Controller". The project was designed by integrating components in the MVC
architectural pattern into the layered structuring in the n-tier architectural pattern. This
design includes four physical layers as “Business Layer”, “Data Access Layer”, “Entity
Layer” and “Presentation Layer”.
The project is prepared as "ASP.NET Web Application" in .Net Framework, a platform
offered by Microsoft and used to develop applications running on Windows operating
systems. ASP.NET is used to create web-based applications that run on the browser.
During the development, Entity Framework, an ORM (Object to Relational Mapping)
tool created by Microsoft, was used. Entity Framework allows processing of relational
database to be done easily with object oriented programming. Here, Entity Framework's
"Code First" method is used. Thanks to this method, the database is prepared by coding
in the Visual Studio environment instead of being prepared in a database management
system. This method increases the flexibility of the project as it makes the project
independent in the database.
The project was developed in Microsoft Visual Studio with the C# programming
language. HTML5, JavaScript and CSS languages are used for the front-end design of the
website.
